Developer's Guide
===============================

* First setup the environment by installing all dependencies using the Dependencies.sh script present in the home of OpenFASOC github repository. To test whether the installation happened correctly or not, try running the temp-sense-gen;

* Once the setup is ready, read the "Things to improve" under this section (right below) and start working on them;

* You can also start working on improving the code base, docs, CI flow, improving the generators or creating your own generator.

.. note::
    
    If you'd like to suggest new features, enhancements or bug fixes, feel free to `submit an issue <https://github.com/idea-fasoc/OpenFASOC/issues>`_ in the GitHub repo.
