# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.

# FVF Dataset Generation - Large Files and Directories
# =======================================================
# Note: FVF datasets can be 10GB-170GB+ in size
# Individual samples: ~2-5MB each (GDS + reports + PEX files)
# 2K dataset: ~10GB total, 34K dataset: ~170GB total

# Large dataset directories (2K, 34K samples, etc.)
