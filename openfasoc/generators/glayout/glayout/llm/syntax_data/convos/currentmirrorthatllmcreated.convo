# Define parameters for the width, length, and multiplier of the transistors in the current mirror
create float parameter called ref_width
create float parameter called ref_length
create int parameter called ref_multiplier
create float parameter called mirr_width
create float parameter called mirr_length
create int parameter called mirr_multiplier
# Place the reference and mirror NFETs
place an nfet called reference with width ref_width length ref_length multipliers ref_multiplier
place an nfet called mirror with width mirr_width length mirr_length multipliers mirr_multiplier
# Move the mirror NFET, ensuring the sources of reference and mirror are connected (assuming they start connected by default)
move mirror by 0,0  # If the EDA tool places them at the same Y-coordinate initially, this command can ensure they stay connected
# Route connections between the reference NFET gate and its drain, and between the mirror NFET gate and the reference gate
