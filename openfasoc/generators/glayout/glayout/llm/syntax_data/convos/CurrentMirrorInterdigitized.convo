# create parameters in alphabetical order
Create a float parameter called length
Create an int parameter called numfingers
Create a float parameter called width
# place list out all parameters (some are different than default) in order they appear in the function call
# use a/an depending on english grammar (an before a vowel)
place an interdigitated nfet called cmirror with numcols=numfingers, dummy=True, with_substrate_tap=False, with_tie=True, tie_layers=("met2","met1"), kwargs={ "width" : width , "length" : length }
# route between ... and ... 
# if you dont specify anything that means you are doing smart_route on a supported circuit
# which means you do not need to specify a direction, in this case always set direction to East and dont specify route type
# if you have to specify a direction, then always specify route type (even if you are using smart_route)
route between cmirror_A_drain_E and cmirror_A_gate_E
route between cmirror_A_gate_E and cmirror_B_gate_E
route between cmirror_A_source_E and cmirror_B_source_E
# coming soon, also route ground/power
