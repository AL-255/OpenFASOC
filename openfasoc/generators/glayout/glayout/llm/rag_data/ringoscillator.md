# Ring Oscillator

## Purpose

A ring oscillator is a type of electronic oscillator that produces a periodic oscillating electronic signal (often a square wave). It consists of an odd number of NOT gates or inverters whose output is connected back to the input, forming a closed loop. The main purpose of the ring oscillator is to generate a high-frequency clock signal and for use in integrated circuits as a timing element. It's also frequently used in characterizing and testing the properties of semiconductor technologies, such as propagation delay and signal integrity.

## Terms Defined

Inverter: A logic gate that outputs the complement (opposite) of its input signal. <br />
Propagation Delay (t_pd): The time delay it takes for a signal to pass through one stage of the circuit, such as an inverter. <br />
Frequency (f): The frequency of oscillation, determined by the number of inverters and the propagation delay.

## Theory

The operation of a ring oscillator is based on the propagation delay inherent in the inverters. When the loop is closed, an initial change in voltage at the first inverter's input propagates through each inverter in the chain. Since an odd number of inverters are used, the output of the last inverter is an inverted version of the original signal, which becomes the input to the first inverter, perpetuating the oscillation. The frequency of oscillation is inversely proportional to the total propagation delay through the loop (the sum of the delay through each inverter and any delay from wiring) and can be estimated by:

$[ f = \frac{1}{t_{pd} \times N} ]$

where $( t_{pd} )$ is the individual delay for one inverter and ( N ) is the number of inverters.

## Schematic

### Described in Words

A ring oscillator circuit uses an odd number of inverters connected in series. The output of the last inverter is fed back to the input of the first, creating a feedback loop.

### Pseudo Netlist

A pseudo netlist of a ring oscillator can be written as:.subckt ringoscillator out X1 out net1 INV X2 net1 net2 INV ... XN net(N-1) out INV .endsubckt

In this netlist, X1...XN denote individual inverters, net1...net(N-1) represent internal connections between inverters, and INV stands for the inverter model.

## Performance Specifications

Performance characteristics of a ring oscillator include:

Frequency Stability: Often limited due to sensitivity to supply voltage variations and temperature changes. <br />
Power Consumption: Related to the number of stages and the frequency of operation, with higher frequencies generally leading to higher power usage. <br />
Phase Noise: The short-term frequency stability of the oscillator, affected by the quality of the inverters and the supply noise.
