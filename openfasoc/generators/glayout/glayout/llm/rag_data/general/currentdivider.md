# Current Divider

## Purpose

A current divider is a circuit used to distribute an input current among multiple parallel branches according to their resistances. It is mainly utilized when one needs to have different current values in various parts of a circuit, such as in various sensors or transducers connected in parallel. It's a practical application of Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's current law (KCL).

## Terms Defined

I_in: The total input current entering the parallel network. <br />
I_out: The output current through a particular branch resistor. <br />
R_total: The equivalent resistance of the parallel network. <br />
Rn: Usually refers to an individual resistor within the set of parallel resistors. <br />

## Theory

A current divider leverages Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's current law to split the currents in a parallel network. The current flowing through a resistor in parallel is inversely proportional to its resistance and directly proportional to all other resistances in the network. The formula for the current I_n through a specific branch resistor R_n is given by:

$[ I_n = I_{in} \times \frac{R_{total}}{R_n} ]$

R_total is calculated as the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of all resistances in the network:

$[ \frac{1}{R_{total}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{R_n} ]$

## Schematic

### Described in Words

In a current divider circuit, resistors are arranged in parallel all sharing the same two nodes. The total current enters at the first node, flows through each parallel branch, and exits the second node, where the sum of the branch currents equates to the total current entering the network.

### Pseudo Netlist

A pseudo netlist of a current divider can be written as:
.subckt currentdivider In R1 R2 ... Rn R1 In Out VALUE_OF_R1 R2 In Out VALUE_OF_R2 Rn In Out VALUE_OF_Rn .endsubckt

In this pseudo netlist, In is the node where the input current enters. R1...Rn are resistors with VALUE_OF_R1...VALUE_OF_Rn specified in ohms, and Out serves as the common connection point that combines the individual currents back together.

## Performance Specifications

Critical performance parameters for a current divider include:

Current Sharing Accuracy: Defined by the tolerance of the resistors. <br />
Power Dissipation: Each resistor needs to have a sufficient power rating to safely dissipate the heat generated by the current passing through it. <br />
Temperature Stability: Resistance changes with temperature, which affects current division, so resistors with low temperature coefficients are preferable for higher precision.
