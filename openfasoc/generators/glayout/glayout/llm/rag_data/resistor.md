# Resistor

## Purpose

A resistor is a passive electrical component that provides electrical resistance in an electronic circuit. The main purpose of a resistor is to limit electrical current, divide voltages, and dissipate power as heat. They are essential in creating specific voltage or current relationships in circuits, adjusting signal levels, biasing active elements, and terminating transmission lines, among many other applications.

## Ohm's Law

The fundamental characteristic of a resistor is described by Ohm's Law, which states that the current (I) through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage (V) across the two points and inversely proportional to the resistance (R) of the conductor:

$[ V = I \times R ]$

## Construction and Characteristics

Resistors can be constructed from various materials, such as carbon, metal film, or wires wound around a core. They are specified by resistance value, power rating, tolerance, temperature coefficient, and stability. The resistance value determines how much it will oppose current flow, while the power rating specifies the maximum power it can dissipate without damage.
Schematic Symbol

The schematic symbol for a resistor is typically a zigzag line with two protruding terminals representing the points of electrical connection. European schematics sometimes use a simple rectangle instead of the zigzag symbol.


## Performance Specifications

Resistance: The main parameter of a resistor, typically measured in ohms (Ω). <br />
Tolerance: Indicates how much the actual resistance can vary from the specified value, often given as a percentage (e.g., ±1%, ±5%). <br />
Power Rating: The maximum power, usually in watts (W), that a resistor can safely dissipate as heat. <br />
Temperature Coefficient: Describes how the resistance changes with temperature, important for precision applications.

Resistors are reliable, economical, and widely available components that remain integral to nearly every electronic circuit. Whether used singly or in networks, resistors shape the behavior of circuits in predictable and controllable ways.
