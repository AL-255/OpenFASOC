# Opamp
An operational amplifier or opamp is a voltage amplifying device.
## Terms Defined
Inverting Input (IN-): The input terminal where the signal is inversely amplified. <br />
Non-inverting Input (IN+): The input terminal where the signal is amplified retaining its original phase. <br />
Output Terminal: Where the amplified signal is provided. <br />
Power Supply Ports: Two ports, one for the positive power supply voltage (V+), and one for the negative (V-). <br />
Bias Current: The current that flows into the input terminals due to internal transistor biasing. <br />
Open-Loop Gain: The amplification factor of the operational amplifier without any feedback. <br />
Slew Rate: The maximum rate at which the output voltage can change, often specified in V/Âµs. <br />
Offset Voltage: A small voltage that must be applied between the input terminals to ensure a zero volt output without any signal.
### In Words
The op amp symbol consists of a triangle pointing to the right with five terminals: two input terminals on the left side, one output terminal on the triangle's right tip, and two power supply terminals (-V and +V) at the top and bottom respectively. The non-inverting input (IN+) is usually shown at the top left of the triangle, and the inverting input (IN-) is depicted below it.
